            <h2>Dérica Christine Gilroy</h2>
            <p>I am your textbook definition of the word 'nerd'. As a lover of all things Mathematics and Computer Science, 
               I get overly excited about my new calculators, I think about programs I could write to make my life easier,
               and could quite literally die of laughter from a good math or programming joke. I am currently in my final
               (hopefully) year of the Actuarial Science program at the University of the West Indies, Mona Campus and am 
               hoping to become an actuary and a data analyst.</p>
            <p>While web development is unrelated to my studies and career aspirations, I am not deterred from wanting to
               learn something new. Whenever I scroll the websites for tech companies like Apple and Samsung, I'm always 
               amazed by how interactive and immersive the pages are. I almsot instinctively start to think about the 
               programming behind the visual effects, and I hope to be exposed to the like in this course. My intention is 
               not to start freelancing, but who knows what the future holds....</p>
            <p>I thought I'd share a laugh:</p>
